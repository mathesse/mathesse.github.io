DEM Digital Elevation Model
Topographic Background Images

------------------------------------
Projection:  The DEM image has been reprojected to mesh with the V4 datasets: Gauss Kruger Xian 1980 Zone 19.


Description:   The DEM background image tile was processed from the public domain GTOPO-30 DEM datasets published by United States Geological Survey.  The image processing and color ramp selection was done by Dr. Zhimin Man, Center for Historical Geography, Fudan University.

-----------------------------


Pixel Resolution:   GTOPO-30 has a resolution of approximately 30 arc seconds per pixel. This equates to approximately 1 kilometer in central China.

Note on Color Ramp (when using ArcGIS):   If the image seems to have lost the correct color values (for example appearing to show all land area as solid red) try adjusting the color ramp in ArcGIS as follows:

1> right click on the DEM layer, go to PROPERTIES, and click on the SYMBOLOGY tab
2> should be set to RGB Composite
3> set the Stetch Type = Minimum - Maximum
4> hit OK
