## Story

Professor A: "Would you mind generating a list with local restaurants? We would like to put it on the conference program book. If there is a map and a table, that would be the best!"

"Something like this..."

## Lazy as I amâ€¦ would never do manually insert:)

The basic idea is to grasp information from Yelp or Google with **location** information, and some other factors, if interested.

Feels that yelp has more review counts and thus I chose **Yelp**.

### Yelp API could do this

Yelp API has Business Endpoints including [Business Search](https://www.yelp.com/developers/documentation/v3/business_search) and [Business Details](https://www.yelp.com/developers/documentation/v3/business), which could satisfy my needs.

- To use Yelp Fusion API, you need [API Keys](https://www.yelp.com/developers/documentation/v3/authentication#where-is-my-client-secret-going) since March 1, 2018 since the API no longer uses OAuth 2.0 for requests and moved over to only API Keys. All you need to do is to fill a form indicating that you are creating an app and that's it. Once done, you could find the API Keys on [Manage App](https://www.yelp.com/developers/v3/manage_app).
- The request is simple `GET https://api.yelp.com/v3/businesses/search`. Yelp has help page [Business Search](https://www.yelp.com/developers/documentation/v3/business_search) and you could find query parameters and specify what will be your responses.
- Common query parameters include
  - term: if you search for `term = ""` then API gives results for all business, not only limited to restaurants. I found this tricky and weird since API actually returns nothing when I indicate `term = "food"` or `term = "restaurants"`, and `term = ""` only returns food-related business in my interested area.
  - categories: well, if you search for `categories = "latin"` you will get nothing. Probably due to the fact that the categories is a list.
  - location OR latitude + longitude: I feel lat+lon might be easier to use, since you could easily find the values from [a converter using address](https://www.latlong.net/convert-address-to-lat-long.html).
  - radius: unit is meter. How it is from central location. Largest possible value is 40000 meters.
  - limit: 50 maximum one time, but you could combine the datasets. Pay attention that the API has a limit as well.
  - sort_by: by default it is best_match, however I feel more comfortable using review_count and rating. Distance is also a possible option.
  - price: 1($)-4($$$$).
- Common responses could include
  - name
  - categories (use title for display): returns a list.
  - phone (use display_phone)
  - distance
  - is_closed: Yelp has information of business that are permanently closed.
  - location: address, city, state, zip code: zip code is necessary if you assume your potential readers are going to use Map apps! A lesson from life!
  - rating
  - review counts
  - transactions: this is a list! When you are going to write results to excel, make sure to convert it to string.

## Sample code

```R
# restaurant info #
# --------------- #
require(tidyverse)
require(httr)
# build the url for query, use API key instead of token from March, 2018
# function to parse and format the data and do the search
yelp_business_search <- function(term = NULL,

*With the data, now you could plot the map and generate kable tables:)*



## Reference

- [An R package to search for businesses at a location](https://github.com/walshc/YelpAPI): this package is written before  Yelp moves to API Keys from tokens, so you could download the raw code and manually adapt it.
- [Using the Yelp API with R](https://billpetti.github.io/2017-12-23-use-yelp-api-r-rstats/): very useful sample code, however also written before API keys, so minor adaptation.
